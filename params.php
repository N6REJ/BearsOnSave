 * Each template tab should have its own "section" just like it currently is in the framework files.
 * After its all moved over here you can probably delete all framework param files.
 * THIS FILE WILL NOT CREATE THE .CSS, IT'S ONLY TO POPULATE THE PARAMETERS AND CREATE THE $CSS VAR
 * the benefit of doing it this way is the user only changes this file as the template changes so the
 * plugin never has to change!  It's truly template agnostic.
